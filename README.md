# Music-Genre-Classification
### Introduction
### About
Our project is a research â€“ based analysis of the music genres using spectral and rhythmic features of the music We have done a comparative study using various machine learning algorithms to classify the music into its various genres namely, blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal and pop respectively. We have used various audio features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Delta, Delta- Delta and temporal features, including beats and tempo to featurize our data. Various classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier are used in the classification of the data.
### Dataset
Contains 1000 music files. Dataset has ten types of genres with uniform distribution. Dataset has the following genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, reggae, rock, metal, and pop. Each music file is 30 seconds long.</br>
Genres original - A collection of 10 genres with 100 audio files each, all having a length of 30 seconds.</br>
Images original - A visual representation for each audio file. One way to classify data is through neural networks. Because NNs (like CNN, what we will be using today) usually take in some sort of image representation, the audio files were converted to Mel Spectrograms to make this possible. </br>
The files were collected in 2000-2001 from a variety of sources including personal CDs, radio, microphone recordings, in order to represent a variety of recording conditions.</br>
