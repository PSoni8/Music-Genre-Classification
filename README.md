# Music-Genre-Classification
### Introduction
### About
Our project is a research â€“ based analysis of the music genres using spectral and rhythmic features of the music We have done a comparative study using various machine learning algorithms to classify the music into its various genres namely, blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal and pop respectively. We have used various audio features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Delta, Delta- Delta and temporal features, including beats and tempo to featurize our data. Various classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier are used in the classification of the data.
